## A note on pixel density
Some modded armors don't have the same pixel density as vanilla armors (especially if they have a custom model). 
*Textures in this resource pack may use the default pixel density*. It can lead to disalignments, but in my opinion this is an okay compromise. It's that or have a missing texture.
Of course, same-density textures will have higher priority in PRs than default-density textures.
